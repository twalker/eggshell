eggshell
========

a starting point for hatching ideas.

------

There are tons of delightful generators and boilerplates out there.
This isn't one of them. It's just a skeleton to work out ideas using 
patterns and tools I enjoy.

Because when I want to get crackin' on an idea, 
I want to write code instead of reading configuration documentation.
